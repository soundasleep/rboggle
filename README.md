## Dictionary

The dictionaries used are the English and English (GB) dictionaries,
with the first set of acceptable variants, obtainable from http://wordlist.aspell.net/scowl-readme/.
This is because not all operating systems have dictionaries, and often these dictionaries
do not provide plural versions.

These can be browsed in [dict/](dict/) and updated as necessary.
At last count there were approximately ~244,000 words.
